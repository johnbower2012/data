	This file uses "pca.cpp" and "armadillo" to conduct Principle Component Analysis. PCA is
	a rotation whereby the new axes are in the directions of greatest variance for the data,
	ordered {t_i} such that t_1 is in the direction of greatest variance, t_2 the next, and
	so forth.

	One begins with a matrix of dimensions n-by-d, here called the "val_matrix," where there 
	are n-repitions of a d-dimensional row vector, that is the 'i'th row is a different 
	measurement of a set of d values, {x_j}_i, and the 'j'th column is a set of n values, 
	{x_i}_j, each x_i a new measurement of the 'j'th dimension.

	PCA functions by first translating and scaling each column to have zero mean and unit 
	variance, here called the "zval_matrix". Then, it is desired to find weights, W = {w_i},
	each |w_i| = 1, such that T = Z*W has as its axes the directions of great variance. In 
	this aim, the covariance matrix for the zval_matrix is constructed and its eigenvalues 
	& vectos found. If w_1 is the eigenvector corresponding to lambda_1 = max{lambda_i}, 
	then t_1 will be the PC in the direction of greatest variance. If we also then arrange 
	lambda_1 > lambda_2 > ... > lambda_n, with corresponding {w_i}, we then have our {t_i} 
	vectors in order of greatest to least variance.

	The mathematical proof of this arrangement follows from the fact that we want our t_1
	to satisfy t_1 = max{|w_T*Z_T*Z*w|} with |w| = 1, which is the equivalent of 
	t_1 = max{|w_T*Z_T*Z*w/(w_T*w)|} since |w| = 1. This can be recognized as the Rayleigh
	Quotient, where the maximum is known to be the largest eigenvalue of Z_T*Z and occurs
	when w is the corresponding eigenvector. Lastly, Z_T*Z = SUM_over_k(z_ki*z_kj) = cov(Z),
	and so the above has been shown (mostly).
